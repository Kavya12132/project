<h1><mark> My School</mark></h1>
<p>I go to Hunt Middle School (HMS), I was in sixth grade but am moving to seventh. I chose band as my elective and I play the clarinet.</p>
<h3><ins> My Classes</ins></h3>
<p> My favorite class would be Academy Connect and my least favorite class would be PE & ILA. My first class of the day was Academy Connect and my last class of the day was Math.
<h3><ins>Academy Connect</ins></h3>
<p>Academy Connect is the class where you would learn things about money, coding and typing.</p>
<h3><ins><sub> Band</sub></ins></h3>
<p> In band I play the clarinet along with other clarinet player and trumpet players. There are two band directors that teach us. </p>
<h3><ins> Science</ins></h3>
<p> My science teacher was really nice and she had this thing where your class would earn points, and if your class got the highest set of points compared to others then you would get some candy.</p>
    <h3> <ins><small>ILA</small></ins></h3>
    My ILA was split between lunch I would have one half of class and then I would go too lunch which would last about 30 minutes and come back and finish the other half of ILA, we would learn Reading & Writing.
    <h3> <ins>PE</ins></h3>
    <p> In PE we would do warm-ups <em>first</em> than actually start doing something sometimes if the weather was Ok then we had to go outside and run/walk on the track.</p>
    <h3><ins>Advisory</ins></h3>
    <p>Advisory isnt really a class, everyone in the grade has it at the same time. Advisory is a time where you can just hangout in class and do whatever you your teacher allows you to, its also a time where you finish any work or you go to other classes because they need you to finish something or catch up on something.</p>

        <p><bold>In social studies we learn about world cultures and different regions</bold></p>
        <h3><ins>Math</ins></h3>
        <p> we learn about math</p>
